# Blog migration from Jekyll

I created directory redesign where the new site will be build. After successfully moving from old setup to new jekyll codebase will be removed.
To this directory I installed gatsby with gatsby xli and default starter kit.

`npm install -g gatsby-cli`

After that I run `gatsby new redesign`
